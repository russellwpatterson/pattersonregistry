Thank you so much for visiting. Our first child, Ruben Wayne Patterson, will be here around March 2nd, and we couldn't be more excited! He's going to be named after Sarah's grandfather and will have the same middle name as Russell and his dad. We're planning to call him "Benny" as a nickname while he's young.

We're going with a jungle/safari theme in his nursery, so anything with animals should go well with that. Of course, we're thankful for anything you get us, but here are our registry links for some ideas. Again, we appreciate it, and we hope to see you at one of our baby showers! 

Love,\
Sarah and Russell
